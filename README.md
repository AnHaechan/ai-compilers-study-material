## AI compilers study materials 

### Description
This repository is designed as a focused resource for individuals beginning work in the field of AI compilers and systems.

​By AI compilers, I specifically refer to the software stack responsible for translating and optimizing DNN models into efficient assembly code for various accelerators, including GPUs and NPUs.

​I have curated the most valuable resources I've encountered to date to provide a solid starting point.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of DNN and Transformer architectures.
- Some experience on parallel programming and GPUs (e.g., implementing matmul on CUDA).

### Introductions

### State of AI compilers
- In the pre-LLM era, AI compilers consist of **graph compilers + kernel libraries / compilers**. 
  - Graph compilers perform various computational graph-level optimizations.
  - Kernels for individual operators can be crafted by direct programming (*kernel libraries*) or automatic generation (*kernel compilers*).
  - [TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm) and [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla) were the most popular compiler frameworks.
- After the domination of LLMs, the focus has shifted to **LLM runtimes + attention kernels**.
  - LLMs, or autoregressive Transformers with self-attention, has become the core workload.
  - Hence, it is crucial to optimize its performance to the last bit via runtime strategies and custom attention kernels.
  - [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) runtime with attention kernels written in [CUTLASS](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/index.html) or [Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) is a popular choice.
- Nonetheless, AI compilers remain to be an important topic. 
  - Graph compilers can accelerate the rest of the model[[example](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/08/20/torch-compile.html)], used together with custom attention kernels.
  - Kernel programming, especially for recent GPU architectures, remains to be complex and ad-hoc[[paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.07004v1)].
  - AI compilers can support faster prototyping for different attention algorithms, or even non-Transformer models [[mamba](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00752)].

### Papers
- [List of papers](https://github.com/merrymercy/awesome-tensor-compilers)
- There is [a survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03794), but keep in mind that it is a bit outdated (2020).
- I'd recommend skimming through recent ML/DNN/AI compiler papers on ASPLOS/MLSys/PLDI/ISCA, such as [Relax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02103), [Cypress](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07004), [Exo2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07211).
- FlashAttention series and PagedAttention are also recommended to understand the gist of kernel optimization for LLMs[[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135)][[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08691)][[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08608)][[decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01282)][[paged](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06180)].

### Frameworks
#### Graph compilers + Kernel libraries
- NVIDIA [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT) + [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
  - Core logics are closed-sourced.
- Intel [OpenVino](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) + [oneDNN](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneDNN)

#### Graph & Kernel compilers
- [TorchInductor](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/torch/_inductor)
- [TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm)
- [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla)

#### LLM runtimes
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
- NVIDIA [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM)

#### Kernel languages
- NVIDIA [CUTLASS](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/index.html)
- [Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton)
  - For recent Hopper/Blackwell GPUs, Triton struggles to achieve optimal performance due to the increased complexity of GPU.
  - To mitigate this, [Gluon](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/python/tutorials/gluon/01-intro.py) is being developed within the Triton ecosystem, which exposes more lower-level controls akin to CUTLASS.
